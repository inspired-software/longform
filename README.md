# Longform

Longform is an Office OpenXML (OOXML) document processor for technical documentation and reports. Documents may be generated programmatically from Swift code or a Markdown derived format.

## Output Formats

* DOCX (Microsoft Word and Apple Pages)
* HTML (support for custom rendering)

## Status

This project is in early development and is not yet useable.

## TODO

* Add support for adding snippets that can be used elsewhere in the document. For example allow a template to have glossary terms (and tags on those terms for categorization).

## Future Work

* Render document and content using SwiftUI

## Attributions

* The OOXML/HTML/AsciiDoc generation methodology was influenced by [John Sundell's Ink](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Ink)
* Some documentation comments were taken from the [ECMA-376 specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-376/)
